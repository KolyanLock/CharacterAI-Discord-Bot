<!-- ## ü©ºKnown issues
Some **Windows users** are facing the problem of being unable to access character.ai: https://github.com/drizzle-mizzle/CharacterAI-Discord-Bot/issues/28 <br>
If you encounter something similar to:<br>
> `Request failed! (https://beta.character.ai/chat/character/info/)`<br>
> `Response: Forbidden`

First, make sure that you use correct cAI user token.<br>
If it's correct, but you're still getting this error:
- Try to use some VPN. 
- If there's still no luck, or if you're not comfortable with using VPN, sadly, **the only available workaround right now is to use Linux OS** for hosting.<br>
The simplest way is to just install WSL2 with Ubuntu, which is pretty easy to do, and launch this bot from there:<br>
